# My Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website!

This project is supposed to combine my (so far) acquired knowledge in REACT with a living and breathing project to help me apply to my first Junior positions.

## Rules

To help maintain a beautiful and easy to understand codebase and pull requests, I implemented a few rules to help me achieve this.

- I added the [PostCSS Sorting extension](https://betterprogramming.pub/automatically-order-css-properties-alphabetically-in-vs-code-ec52392e5237) in VS Code to help sort CSS properties alphabetically. 

- I apply [semantic commit messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) to my commits.

- I add short and clear comments to my code, describing components etc.
